## What is this?

A mod for the game `Koikatu` which allows your characters to choose a random outfit. They change their clothes at the start of the day (can be disabled), or when they enter the female bathrooms, the shower room, and the locker room.

These outfits are made by multiple layers of coordinate and/or character cards, selecting one random card per layer - starting from the 1st layer to the last one.

You can make complex outfits by selecting which parts are copied within the cards.
